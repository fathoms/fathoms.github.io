<p><img src="/images/blogcrop2.gif" alt="your image"></p>
<p>Then I would put a write up on it. Due to unforseen circumstances, I accomplished all three things. The write up turned out to be the most Herculean task of them all.</p>
<p>As I sat there redoing the challenges from start to finish, fetching my commands, arranging them into some easily digestible sequence that would fit my narrative, I realised something. The OverTheWire staff really, really don&rsquo;t want write ups of these wargames on the net.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want them on the net enough to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/4j76ap/overthewire_wargamesguide_to_bandit_levels_125/">reddit posts</a> of infosec learners advertising their blog - broadcasting, perhaps, the only kind of content their skills at this time will allow - and comment on them with sad faces.</p>
<p>I mercilessly pruned my proofs-of-concept. My humble, factual tone evaporated. The inconsistent yarn I am left with will likely please neither the staff nor the friends to whom I now write.</p>
<p>Here it is, guys. This is the idiot thing I have edited into oblivion. I can only hope you&rsquo;ll find it useful.</p>
<h2 id="level-0">Level 0:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is <strong>bandit.labs.overthewire.org</strong>, on port 2220. The username is <strong>bandit0</strong> and the password is <strong>bandit0</strong>. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know why you should read the man pages? Here’s why you should read the man pages. I was trying to ssh in from memory. I was like, oh, p<em>ssh</em>, I’ve done this before. They’ve given me the info, I’ll just spew out the arguments like so:</p>
<pre><code>n615:~ user$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org 2220
bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
</code></pre><p>I presumed the port number could be tacked on as a generic argument at the end. Not so; this isn&rsquo;t telnet. If you want to specify an ssh port other than the default 22, you’re going to need the <code>-p</code> option. I like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40654885">this</a> explanation of arguments and options and such.</p>
<p>Everyone messes up the command options or argument order once in a while. That’s why you should read the man pages.</p>
<h2 id="level-0-1">Level 0-1</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several commands you’ll be using constantly from now on to be able to look and get around. Learn how to get <em>out</em> of directories as well as <em>in</em>. Get the flag. Seize the means of production.</p>
<h2 id="level-1-2">Level 1-2</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>cat</code> got your tongue? (Sorry.)</p>
<p>You can start by checking its usage in the man pages first of all, to see why it doesn’t work as you’d expect.</p>
<p>Second of all, everything that can be stored in a Linux file system is identified by its unique path. If you can picture every directory that was entered to get to this location, you can construct the absolute path for this oddly-named file and feed it to <code>cat</code> - or indeed any other command that expects a file as an argument.</p>
<p>But in practice, nobody knows - or wants to type out - the whole entire absolute path for everything. What if you couldn’t leave bandit1’s home directory? (You can.) What then? (Think about it anyway.)</p>
<h2 id="level-2-3">Level 2-3</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read the stack overflow answer I linked earlier, you might see how a file with spaces in its name could present a problem with how commands are interpreted.</p>
<p>I personally let autocomplete solve this challenge for me, though.</p>
<h2 id="level-3-4">Level 3-4</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This challenge should make you realise that hidden files aren&rsquo;t exactly a stellar security measure. Hidden files tend to store config details or user preferences, and are generally only removed from view for the purpose of decluttering the average directory listing.</p>
<h2 id="level-4-5">Level 4-5</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
-file00  -file02  -file04  -file06  -file08
-file01  -file03  -file05  -file07  -file09
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file00
??????????~%	C[?걱&gt;??| ? 
</code></pre><p>You could just <code>cat</code> every single file this way, but that&rsquo;s not why you&rsquo;re here. All this time you&rsquo;ve been typing single commands for the shell to interpret, but it&rsquo;s more than capable of doing something a bit more programmatic.</p>
<p>Did you know you can use a semicolon to separate and execute commands sequentially on one line?</p>
<pre><code>bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ echo you; echo do; echo now
you
do
now
</code></pre><h2 id="level-5-6">Level 5-6</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, not executable</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere04  maybehere08  maybehere12  maybehere16

maybehere02  maybehere06  maybehere10  maybehere14  maybehere18
maybehere03  maybehere07  maybehere11  maybehere15  maybehere19
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ 
</code></pre><p>If only there was a command that could allow you to find files with really specific criteria.</p>
<h2 id="level-6-7">Level 6-7</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties: owned by user bandit7, owned by group bandit6, 33 bytes in size</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somewhere.</p>
<pre><code>bandit6@bandit:~$ ls
bandit6@bandit:~$ ls -la
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Oct 16  2018 .

-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  675 May 15  2017 .profile
</code></pre><p>Not here. But even if you apply your knowledge from the previous level, you’ll get a lot of errors drowning out what you actually want to see. Use google to figure out how to stop this.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, all complaints about this blog post should be sent to /dev/null.</p>
<h2 id="level-7-8">Level 7-8</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a present for you.</p>

</code></pre><p>That present is the <code>head</code> command (and its counterpart, <code>tail</code>). It’s extremely convenient if you have reason to expect that a file is large and don’t want to clutter your terminal with all lines read at once.</p>
<p>But it’s not actually relevant to the solution of this challenge. Sorry.</p>

</code></pre><p>Have you ever wondered why this gibberish displays as it does? What does human-readable vs. non-human-readable actually mean? And what on earth is a Chinese glyph meaning ‘dried fish’ doing in data.txt???</p>
<pre><code>bandit9@bandit:~$ file data.txt 
data.txt: data
</code></pre><p>Files are sequences of bytes. File formats signal for these bytes to be interpreted a certain way with particular bytes in in particular places.</p>
<p>This file (much like this blog post) is painstakingly crafted yet all over the place, and aims to teach you something. <code>file</code> can’t be sure what it is, though, hence the highly descriptive output.</p>
<p>As for <code>cat</code>, it will have the terminal attempt to display the byte values as characters in a printable format. It will fail for many of them. One value, though, seems to match the Unicode for ‘dried fish’. Nya nya.</p>
<p>Anyway, you’ve been assured that there’s wheat in this chaff. So there’s surely a way to separate it.</p>

</code></pre><p>The main takeaway from this level should be that those equal signs at the end are generally a dead giveaway of something that’s base64-encoded.</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s the one thing you’ll remember from Bandit, even if you forget all the other stuff.</p>

<p>ROT-13 is not used to scramble anything important, ever. It seems to serve entirely as a hat tip to the aspiring cryptographic badass. It&rsquo;s also featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9CBKGLVCME">on that one show about leet hackers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="level-12-13">Level 12-13</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)</p>

<p>This challenge is good. Why is it good? Because it forces you practise the thing, over and over again, until you’re screaming “I understand it, already! No more!”</p>

bandit12@localhost's password:
</code></pre><p>This works because you are working in an ssh session logged in as bandit12, and localhost points to that machine (which is technically remote relative to your own).</p>
<p>Why is the port omitted? Going from your own machine you needed to specify port 2220 because that&rsquo;s what was open to hosts <em>external</em> to the OverTheWire network.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re already logged into a user on that network, the default port 20 is open for sshing internally. You can verify this with <code>nmap</code>, which will come up in a few levels’ time.</p>
<p>Also, don’t forget to <code>cat</code> the password when you get there.</p>

<p>The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.</p>

<p>This was another one I did off the top of my head. I first used <code>telnet</code>, but <code>telnet</code> is a loser and we can do better. Research the better thing. It is incredibly useful.</p>

<p>The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.
Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…
Another case of RTFmanpage. Personally, I didn’t run into the situation that their helpful note mentions. Maybe if you read the manpage well enough, you won’t either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you might have realised by now. You can’t just walk through life expecting the terminal to give you helpful prompts all the time. Sometimes you’re going to get something that looks like it’s hanging, but isn’t.</p>
<p>Test it. Type stuff anyway. <code>whoami</code> is a great option if you have no idea; it prints what user you’re logged in as. Very nice for illustrating solutions, but <strong>as you know</strong> I decided to cut those out.</p>

<p>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000.

There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meet <code>nmap</code>, your new best friend.</p>
<p>I recommend you use the <code>-sV</code> flag for service detection. It predicts what service could be listening on open ports. I first solved this one without it and didn’t learn the useful thing early enough.</p>
<p>Also meet vim, that one friend you keep avoiding. At least learn how to create files, edit files, and how to exit the damn thing.</p>
<p>Well, what else are you suggesting I remotely edit files with? <em>emacs?</em> And I suppose you would also have me roll around in the mud like a common sow?</p>
<p>But seriously. The reason you should know how to use vim is similar to another reason why you should read the man pages. If you truly intend to go digging around remote machines, you’re not always going to be able to use your favourite text editor. In the same way, it’s best to be comfortable using the most accurate and built-in documentation possible.</p>

<p>Recall that we have bandit18’s password and can actually login with ssh. Maybe you should stop taking that utility for granted and see how else it can be used.</p>
<p>Also if you didn’t know, <code>bash</code> is itself a statement that can be invoked. So is <code>exit</code>. If you find a way to inspect <code>.bashrc</code>, you will be able to see that the offending lines added are merely the following:</p>

</code></pre><p>I’m going to <del>hope</del> assume that you have done some of your own reading on permissions and can meaningfully read the above by now. The s flag may still be new.</p>
<p>That flag being set where it is allows the executable to be run with the privileges of its owner (in this case bandit20). If it was instead set where the x is, the executable would be run with the privileges of the bandit19 user group.</p>
<p>Since this level is pretty straightforward, I’ll forgo any further advice and instead tell you about how I went on a silly adventure to find out the userid of bandit20 then pass it as an argument to the binary.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is: don’t do that.</p>
<h2 id="level-20-21">Level 20-21</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).
NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your own network daemon. The source of your SYNs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to go astray here. I thought about that setuid binary first and got stuck. It needs a port, but <em>what</em> port?</p>
<p>Whatever its value, it surely won’t be that of any well known service like ssh. What service could it be? What service is it expecting? Even if you desperately <code>nmap</code> for an answer, you won’t find what you need.</p>
<p>Because the service it’s expecting is as simple and specific as “something that connects and yields a line of text”. After all, the binary needs something to read. <em>You</em> can create this service, using the pipes and redirections that are hopefully becoming more familiar to you by now.</p>
<p>In the end, the port value only matters insofar as the two halves of the connection - listener (or n̶et̵̀w̸͠o҉͜r̶k͏̶ d̨a҉̧eḿ̢͞ơn̶̛) and initiator - know where to meet. This level is tricky because you have to make both, in the same session, when you’ve only really been initiating so far.</p>

<p>We’ve been told bandit26’s shell is not the /bin/bash we’re used to using. How can we find out what bandit26 is using? By looking in /etc/passwd. Though password hashes are no longer stored here, there&rsquo;s still some useful information about the users on the machine.</p>

<pre><code>bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
</code></pre><p>That’s it. A tiny custom toy shell made just for this challenge. All this login shell does is export an environment variable then run that <code>more</code> command on whatever text.txt is in bandit26’s home directory is, before terminating, i.e. logging us out.</p>
<pre><code>bandit25@bandit:~$ ls -la /usr/bin | grep showtext
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root     root          53 Oct 16  2018 showtext
</code></pre><p>The permissions don&rsquo;t allow us to edit this shell or anything. But we have plenty of other leads. Maybe there’s a way to exploit how the shell works.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what <code>more</code> is, look it up. It’s a paging command. Research paging. Paging should be a familiar sort of concept. Why? Because manpages use pagers! That&rsquo;s how we navigate through them. (Did you know you can <code>man</code> <code>man</code>?)</p>
<p>If you look at the man page for <code>more</code>, it’s there in the description. A filter for paging through text <em>one screenful at a time</em>.</p>
<p>Some things should be clicking by now, if you’re literally thinking out of the box. That text.txt in bandit26’s home directory - which we can’t read, but can guess pretty well from all this info - is that ascii art. That art is being paged through with <code>more</code>. One screen-full at a time.</p>
<p>So why didn&rsquo;t we get any telltale signs of it being a pager? Why didn&rsquo;t it seem to behave like a man page? Because the terminal screen we’re most likely using is likely bigger than the total contents of that ascii art.</p>
<p>If we made our terminal screen really short - shorter than the amount of lines in the file - and only then logged in as above, could we get into that paging state? If we’re in that paging state, where we don’t scroll past the end of the file, would that mean our exit 0/logout is delayed?</p>
<p>Yes. But what then? Pager exploits. OverTheWire even suggests we look at how vim works. In <code>more</code> you can press v to start up a vim-type editor. Fly free, my pretties, and research the rest.</p>

Some notes for level29 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: xxxxxxxxxx
</code></pre><p>Woe is you, it&rsquo;s been redacted. But if you know anything about git, you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s good at tracking repository history and changes. If something was once written there, there&rsquo;s most definitely a way to check and revert.</p>

<p>Git repositories have branches. By default you commit changes to just the master branch, but if you&rsquo;re doing things right, you branch off into dev, and production, and this or that feature, and so on.</p>

# Bandit Notes
Some notes for bandit30 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit30
- password: &lt;no passwords in production!&gt;
</code></pre><p>If commit history for your current branch isn&rsquo;t turning up much, it would follow to check the others. And any &ldquo;sploit&rdquo; stuff you may come across is a silly red herring.</p>

<pre><code>bandit30@bandit:/tmp/fathoms30/repo$ ls
README.md
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/fathoms30/repo$ cat README.md 
just an epmty file... muahaha
</code></pre><p>Seeing as the file is so &ldquo;epmty&rdquo;, let’s <code>log</code>.</p>
<pre><code>bandit30@bandit:/tmp/fathoms30/repo$ git log
commit 3aa4c239f729b07deb99a52f125893e162daac9e
Author: Ben Dover &lt;noone@overthewire.org&gt;
Date:   Tue Oct 16 14:00:44 2018 +0200

    initial commit of README.md
</code></pre><p>Nope.</p>
<p>So I spent a good while on this one, because there was very little to go off and the solution involves you knowing about the existence of one particular git detail.</p>
<p>The detail is tags. Tags denote versions. Now you know they exist. Find the tag here. The flag is inside. It <em>looks</em> like a commit hash but it&rsquo;s <em>not</em>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used git in practice, even a little, then this challenge checks that you have the bread-and-butter add-commit-push process down.</p>
<pre><code>bandit31@bandit:/tmp/fathoms31/repo$ cat README.md 
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
</code></pre><p>There&rsquo;s a little gotcha after you finish following the instructions, but git is <em>so</em> nice that it tells you outright how to solve it.</p>

<p>After all this git stuff its time for another escape. Good luck!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright. Let&rsquo;s try things.</p>
<pre><code>WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
&gt;&gt; whoami
sh: 1: WHOAMI: not found
</code></pre><p>As you might expect, everything you type is being turned to uppercase. I went down a rabbithole related to <code>stty</code>, so let me tell you now it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with any of that.</p>
<p>I also tried looking in /etc/passwd as bandit31, but due to permissions the custom shell is not readable. So there&rsquo;s no file to decipher. Looks like we need to try other things.</p>
<p>What’s uppercase? Environment variables are uppercase. Will they give me something?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; $TERM
sh: 1: xterm-256color: not found
</code></pre><p>Doesn’t help too much. Or does it? It seems the variables <em>are</em> actually evaluated. Maybe there&rsquo;s something we can evaluate to get a foothold.</p>
